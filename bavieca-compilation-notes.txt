in Bavieca:

Global.h:
* change the #ifdef surrounding NOMINMAX from _WIN32 to _MSC_VER (MS Visual C++ specific macro)
	(applies to a few other files as well, but since this is only a warning it's not crucial)

LexiconManager.h:
* "using namespace __gnu_cxx;" required when typedefing MLexUnit as hash_map under Windows; MinGW-specific?
* hash_map defined differently under Linux and Windows
* also the comparison operator is! This actually breaks down the whole hashmap since find() does not work!

TimeUtils.cpp:
* "#include <cstdio>" required to enable sprintf

BaviecaAPI.h:
* "class extern "X" __declspec(dllexport) BaviecaAPI {" not correctly understood by the compiler (MS-specific code)

FileUtils.h:
* createPath and createFolder not defined under Windows; needed to import io.h and redefine functions without the mode argument

compiling CLAPACK-3.2.1:

* increase stack size for EIG and LIN tests:
	- add "-Wl,--stack,33554432" as parameter to ./xeigtst* in TESTING/EIG/Makefile
	- add "-Wl,--stack,33554432" as parameter to ./xlintstz in TESTING/LIN/Makefile
